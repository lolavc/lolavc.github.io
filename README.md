**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lolavc.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in applying statistics and data analysis to health and forensics.
ðŸ“ˆ Iâ€™m currently studying an MSc in Applied Statistics with Data Science
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects in these areas.

## Here are some of my projects:
### [Harmful alcohol consumption in Scottish urban and rural contexts](https://github.com/lolavc/AlcoholConsumption-/tree/main)
There remains a gap in understanding the specific factors contributing to alcohol consumption patterns in rural Scottish communities despite the growing body of research on this issue. To address this gap, this study explores and compares alcohol consumption patterns in Scottish rural and urban areas, focusing on the socio-demographic and lifestyle factors influencing this behaviour. Employing predictive modelling, the research seeks to understand the dynamics of alcohol consumption in rural communities.

### [Machine Learning Project in Python](https://github.com/lolavc/MLinPython)
The project investigates the estimation of obesity levels utilizing machine learning methods, focusing on unsupervised and supervised techniques. The dataset used is sourced from an online survey conducted on eating habits and physical conditions in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru (Palechor and Manotas, 2019). The primary objective is to evaluate the performance of unsupervised and supervised models in predicting obesity and to compare their effectiveness.

### [Quantitative risk assessment analysis project](https://github.com/lolavc/risk_analysis)
This report details the quantitative risk assessment analysis conducted to evaluate the risk of importing Echinococcus multilocularis (EM) into Great Britain (GB) from dogs returning from a 2-week holiday in France. The analysis focused on key parameters including the probability of a dog becoming infected while on holiday, the likelihood of dog owners not treating their dogs before returning to GB, and the probability that treatment occurs outside the specified window period, considering regulations stipulating treatment between 24 to 120 hours before re-entering GB.

### [Predictor model project](https://github.com/lolavc/predictor_model)
The report outlines the process of building a predictor model to evaluate coronary heart disease (CHD) while considering potential risk factors. 
The dataset utilized originates from a retrospective sample of males residing in Western Cape, South Africa, an area known for its high risk of heart disease. 
Data collection occurred throughout the year 2019.

### [Regression modelling project](https://github.com/lolavc/modelling)
The report details the process of analysing and exploring the Life Expectancy dataset to examine factors that may influence life expectancy across the globe.
