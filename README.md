**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lolavc.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in applying statistics and data analysis to health and forensics.
ðŸ“ˆ Iâ€™m currently studying an MSc in Applied statistics in Data Science
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects in these areas.

## Here are some of my projects:
### [Quantitative risk assessment analysis project](https://github.com/lolavc/risk_analysis)
A quantitative risk assessment analysis was conducted to determine the risk of importing Echinococcus multilocularis (EM) into Great Britain (GB) from dogs returning from a 2-week holiday in France. It is carried out a risk assessment focused on the influence of key parameters: the probability of a dog becoming infected whilst it is on holiday, the probability that dog owners do not treat their dogs before returning to GB and the probability that treatment time is outside the window period, considering a regulation that indicates that treatment must have been given between 24 to 120 hours before re-entering GB.

### [Predictor model project](https://github.com/lolavc/predictor_model)
Build a predictor model to evaluate coronary heart disease (CHD), considering potential risk factors. 
The dataset used is from a retrospective sample of males from Western Cape, South Africa, which has a high risk of heart disease. 
The data were collected throughout 2019.

### [Regression modelling project](https://github.com/lolavc/modelling)
Analyse and explore the life expectancy dataset to examine factors that may influence life expectancy across the globe.
